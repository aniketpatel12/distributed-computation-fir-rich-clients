D) All of the above.

Answer: B

2. Which library was used to implement parallel training in the project?

A) TensorFlow
B) PyTorch
C) Dask
D) Scikit-learn

3. What dataset was used in the research for facial image recognition?

A) CIFAR-10
B) Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW)

Answer: B

4. What is the primary privacy benefit of the proposed distributed machine learning model using rich clients?

A) Raw data is shared with the cloud for further analysis.
B) Personal data remains on edge devices, and only (check points)/(training weights) are shared with servers.
C) Edge devices perform no processing and send all data to the server.
D) The cloud stores all user-specific data securely.

Answer: B

5. In the experimental setup, how does the model ensure that training accuracy for personal data is not compromised when using edge servers?

A) By sharing raw images with the server.
B) By comparing the accuracy of checkpoint files on the edge device with those from the server and selecting the best result.
C) By using cloud servers to process sensitive data.
D) By stopping the training on edge devices once it is transferred to the server.

Answer: B
